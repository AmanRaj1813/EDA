Problem Statement :  The NYC trip duration dataset. The aim of this project is just to explore the dataset and generate insights from it.

Pipeline : 
    Data Understanding -> Data Cleaning -> Data Transformation and Feature Engineering -> Exploratory Visualizations with insights 

Insights Generation from the EDA of the given data set :
1. Inference : Clearly Vendor 2 is preferred by the taxi's consumers at nyc.
2. Inference : From the above count and plot we can see that taxi's of **Vendor 1 have store and fwd flag i.e connectivity issues with server** where as **Vendor 2** doesn't have any of such i.e **it has better server and connectivity to it.**
3. Inference:
        *   Friday has peak frequecy of pickup and sundaywith the least
        *   max. dropoff time in mins ranges more than 20 mins.
4. Inference : Mostly taxi's are in demand for passenger count equal to one which shows people of nyc are solo travellers or dont want to share their taxi's with others.
5. Inference : Customers lying in the longitute -80 to -70 are mostly taxi user so comapany should focus into those areas.
6. Inference : Customers lying in the latitude 40.0 to 42.5 are mostly taxi user so comapany should focus into those areas.
7. Inference :
        *   The pickup hour and the dropoff hour are correlated better so we can say that the model predicting the pickup and dropoff time is working in the                 best predictable way.
        *   The correlation between passenger count and trip duration is very bad with this we can interpret that for long duration journey, people of nyc don't             prefer Taxi services.
8. Inference : This heatmap shows darker the shade more the trips which is observed on **fridays** and **saturdays** of every month and the leading month is **April** with maximum trips followed by **may** .
9. Inference :
       *   18th and 19th hrs of the day is the peak pickup time for taxi's so they can
            make good business in those time period and least in 4th ans 5th hrs of the day so these distribution can be considered.
       *   This also interprets that people prefer to travel more during evening and nights.
10. Inference : Friday the peak day of week for taxi's so they can make good business followed by thursday and saturday.
